# Magic Fortress

This is a project being developed by a team of Games Technology students in the hopes of creating a 20 minute long game, in the span of 3 Months.
By the end, this simple 2D Unity project will end up as a unique twist to the Tower Defense genre of games.

## Main Goals
The main goals for this project are as such:
- Create a game with 20 minutes of gameplay
- Create the game in 3 Months
- Simulate a real world work environment by using industry standard tools, and have weekly meetings

## The Team
The team working on this project is fairly small, however working together should lead to a complete game within the proposed time frame.
These are the team members, and their roles within the project:
- Dominykas Jucys - Project Lead
- Alexander Pearson - Lead Developer
- Jessica Harding - Lead Artist
- Cameron Inglis - Lead Game Design

Although the roles were given out to everyone, team members will regularly help one another in certain aspects of the game development process. This is in the hopes that one party is not too overwhelmed with work, and to simulate a small indie game development team in the real world.

## End Notes
Whent his project will be finished, all documents related to it, including the **Games Design Document** of this project, will be posted either on this GitHub, or as a link to a Google Drive folder. 
This is in the hopes to show any Games Studio the work the team had put in to create this project, and to possibly help in getting Team Members hired.
